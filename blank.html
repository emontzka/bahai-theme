  Although the 20th century witnessed the increasing recognition of principles
  such as universal human rights, democratic ideals, the equality of human
  beings, social justice, the peaceful resolution of conflict, and condemnation
  of the barbarism of war, it wasnevertheless one of the bloodiest centuries in
  all human history. Such a development was unpredicted by classical
  sociological theorists writing in the second half of the 19th century, who
  either did not devote much attention to the question of war and peace or were
  optimistic about the prospects for peace in the 20th century. While war and
  peace were central questions in the social theories of both Auguste Comte
  (1798–1857), the founder of positivism, and Herbert Spencer (1820–1903), the
  founder of evolutionary and synthetic philosophy, for example, both conceived
  of social change as an evolutionary movement towards progress and
  characterized the emerging modern society as essentially peaceful—one in which
  military conquest aimed at the acquisition of land would be replaced with
  economic and industrial competition. Other classical theorists generally
  assumed that war among nations was a thing of the past. Such optimism was
  partly rooted in the relative security of Europe during the 19th century
  where, between the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 and the onset of World
  War I in 1914 there was a relatively long stage of peace, interrupted mainly
  by the German-French war of 1870. However, this security was a mere illusion,
  accompanied as it was by increasing militarism and nationalism in Europe and
  the vast scale of war and genocide perpetrated by European powers in their
  pursuit of colonial conquest in Africa and other parts of the world.

<p>
  Standing in contrast to the misplaced optimism of the classical 19th century
  sociologists is the spiritual figure of Bahá’u’lláh, who was born in 1817 in
  Persia and initiated a transformative global religion centered on the urgency
  and necessity of peace making. He perceived that both the institutional
  structures of the 19th century and their cultural orientation promoted various
  forms of violence, including international wars. The significance of
  Bahá’u’lláh and His insights as they apply to peace movements and peace
  studies is evident through an examination of His worldview and of the manner
  in which His writings reconstruct foundational concepts such as mysticism,
  religion, and social order—emphasizing the replacement of the sword with the
  word.

<h3>Bahá’u’lláh and the Removal of the Sword</h3>
<p>
  Mírzá Husayn ‘Alíy-i-Núrí, who took the title Bahá’u’lláh (the Glory of God),
  was born in Tehran, Iran, in 1817. As a young man, Bahá’u’lláh accepted the
  claim of the young merchant from Shiraz known as the Báb (the Gate) to be the
  Promised One of Shí‘ih Islam. Both the clerics and state authorities in Iran
  declared the Báb’s ideas heretical and dangerous and unleashed a systematic
  campaign of genocide directed at His followers, the Bábís. The Báb Himself was
  executed in 1850—only six years after the announcement of His mission. While
  the writings of the Báb provided fresh and innovative interpretations of
  religious ideas, they pointed to the imminent appearance of a new
  Manifestation (prophet or messenger) of God and defined His entire revelation
  as a preparation for the coming of that great spiritual educator. During a
  massacre of the Bábís in 1852, Bahá’u’lláh was imprisoned in a dungeon in
  Tehran, where He received an epoch-making experience of revelation and
  perceived Himself to be the Promised One of all religions, including the Bábí
  Faith. After four months of imprisonment, and the confiscation of all His
  property, He was exiled to the Ottoman Empire, first to Baghdad, then in 1863
  to Constantinople (Istanbul), and from there to Adrianople (Edirne), and
  finally, in 1868, to the fortress city of ‘Akká in the Holy Land, where He
  died in 1892.
</p>
<p>
  Although Bahá’u’lláh founded a new religion, the meaning, and particularly the
  end purpose, of religion is transformed in His writings. As traditionally
  conceived, religion is often focused on a set of theological doctrines about
  God, prophets, the next world, and the Day of judgment. While these concepts
  are discussed and elucidated in His writings, Bahá’u’lláh emphasizes that He
  has come to renew and revitalize humanity, to reconstruct the world, and to
  bring peace. In His final work, the Book of the Covenant, He describes the
  purpose of His life, sufferings, revelation and writings in this way:
</p>
<blockquote>
  The aim of this Wronged One in sustaining woes and tribulations, in revealing
  the Holy Verses and in demonstrating proofs hath been naught but to quench the
  flame of hate and enmity, that the horizon of the hearts of men may be
  illumined with the light of concord and attain real peace and tranquillity.
</blockquote>
<p>
  In other words, affirming spiritual principles is inseparable from
  transforming the social order and from replacing hatred and violence with love
  and universal peace. From a Bahá’í point of view, then, religion must be the
  cause of unity and concord among human beings, and if it becomes a cause of
  enmity and violence, it is better not to have religion. Making peace is the
  essence of Bahá’u’lláh’s normative orientation and worldview. It is ironic,
  therefore, that both the King of Iran and the Ottoman Sultan rose together
  against Bahá’u’lláh to silence His voice by intriguing to exile Him to the
  city of ‘Akká; however, their oppressive decision in the end only exemplified
  the Hegelian concept of the cunning of Reason, in which Reason realizes its
  plan through the unintended consequences of actions by individuals whose
  intent is their own selfish desires. As Bahá’u’lláh has frequently stated, His
  response to this final exile ordered by these two kings was to publicly
  announce His message to the rulers of the world. Upon arrival in ‘Akká, He
  wrote messages to world leaders, including those of Germany, England, Russia,
  Iran, and France, as well as to the Pope, explicitly declaring His cause and
  calling them all to unite and bring about world peace. The second irony is
  that it was through this exile that He was brought to the Holy Land, where the
  coming of final peace in the world is prophesied to take place, when the wolf
  and lamb will feed together and swords will be beaten into plowshares.
</p>
<p>
  In order to better understand the vital connection between Bahá’u’lláh’s
  revelation and His concern with peace, let us examine that experience of
  revelation in the Tehran dungeon in 1852 which marks the birth of the Bahá’í
  Faith. Bahá’u’lláh describes this experience.
</p>
<h5>1. Reconstruction of Mysticism</h5>
<p>
  In His earlier writings, Bahá’u’lláh directly engages with Persian and Islamic
  forms of mysticism; through these and His later writings, He reconstructs
  mysticism so as to realize its full potential. To understand this point, it is
  useful to refer to the twin concepts of the arc of descent (qaws-i-nuzúl) and
  arc of ascent (qaws-i-ṣu‘úd) which comprise the spiritual or mystical journey.
  The arc of descent is normally perceived as the descent of reality from
  God—the dynamics of material creation, culminating in the emergence of human
  life. As a consequence, however, human beings are estranged from their origin
  and their own truth, which is the unity of God. This yearning for reunion, in
  turn, initiates the arc of ascent, the mystical journey of the soul’s return
  to its source. The arc of ascent, as seen, for example, in the Seven Valleys,
  transcends the realm of conflict and plurality to discover the underlying
  truth of all reality, namely God. With the annihilation of self that is found
  in this unity, one is assumed to have reached the zenith of the arc of ascent.
</p>
<p>
  Although in traditional views of mystical consciousness, the zenith of the arc
  of ascent is the highest and end point of the spiritual journey, in reality
  this is just the beginning of a new stage. But in traditional consciousness
  all humans become sacred and equal only in God. In other words, only when
  living human beings, made of flesh and blood, are divested of their various
  determinations and turned into an abstraction do they become noble and sacred.
  For example, only when women are no longer women—that is, when their concrete
  determinations are negated and annulled in God—do they become equal to men.
  But concrete, living women remain inferior to men in rights, spiritual
  station, and rank. Thus despite the claim to see God in everything, the
  presence of social inequalities including slavery, patriarchy, religious
  discrimination, political despotism, and caste-like distinctions could go
  unchallenged.
</p>
<p>
  As mentioned, Bahá’u’lláh stated that agriculture should be considered first
  among the fundamental principles for the administration of human affairs.
  While agriculture and rural populations have in many ways been marginalized in
  the modern world, the fact remains that civilization is entirely dependent on
  farmers. Both agriculture and non-agricultural industry are needed to support
  civilization, but in the final analysis, agriculture is primary and other
  industry secondary.
</p>
<p>
  Agriculture (which includes forestry and fisheries) is fundamentally different
  from other economic activities in that agriculture’s products result from life
  processes and its means of production are living systems. Beyond providing
  food and other products, as well as incomes, agricultural activities provide
  key ecological services and have a global impact, including an impact on
  climate. This is why no sustainable human future can be conceived unless and
  until the centrality of agriculture is recognized.
</p>

<p>
  It is interesting to note that both Bahá’u’lláh and His successor ‘Abdu’l-Bahá
  (1844–1921) systematically and consistently advocate a unique positive
  definition of peace. Even the word that Bahá’u’lláh uses about the purpose of
  His revelation (iṣláh) means both reform or reconstruction and peace making.
  In many of his writings He calls for ‘imár (development) and iṣláh (peace
  making/reform/reconstruction) of the world. Thus, for Bahá’u’lláh, the
  realization of peace involves simultaneously a reform, reconstruction, and
  development of the institutions and structures of the world; mere desire is
  not a sufficient condition for the realization of a true and lasting peace,
  which requires a fundamental transformation in all aspects of human existence.
  While none of the existing theories provides an adequate path towards peace,
  each pointing only to aspects of the complex question of war and peace,
  Bahá’u’lláh’s multi-dimensional, positive approach encompasses all the factors
  addressed by different contemporary theories. The most explicit expression of
  this is found in His addresses to the leaders of the world, the Súrih of the
  Temple (Súriy-i-Haykal).
